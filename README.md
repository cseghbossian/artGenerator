# artGenerator

The objective of this project is to make some cool pictures while learning about recursive datatypes in Haskell.
To do so, I devised a
grammar for a class of expressions, designed a Haskell
datatype whose values correspond to such expressions, wrote
code to evaluate the expressions, and then created a function
that randomly generates such expressions and plots them. Thus,
producing random psychedelic art.
