# artGenerator

The objective of this project is to make some cool pictures while learning about recursive datatypes in Haskell.
To do so, we devise a
grammar for a certain class of expressions, design a Haskell
datatype whose values correspond to such expressions, write
code to evaluate the expressions, and then write a function
that randomly generates such expressions and plots them thus
producing random psychedelic art.
